----------

### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Causes**

1.  **Primary Cause:**
    
    -   A long-running process initiated by an unoptimized database query caused CPU spikes.
    -   The query was triggered by a bulk data export request which was not throttled.
2.  **Contributing Factors:**
    
    -   Lack of CPU usage monitoring on the server.
    -   Absence of query throttling or limits on the application side.
    -   Inadequate documentation for handling bulk requests.

----------

### **Incident Details**

-   **Description:**  
    At 10:15 AM UTC, monitoring tools detected a sharp increase in CPU utilization on `app-prod-server01`, reaching 100% for over 5 minutes. This caused the Payment Gateway API to fail to respond, leading to degraded performance and transaction timeouts for end-users.
    
-   **Impact:**
    
    -   2,000+ payment transactions were delayed or failed.
    -   Customer support received over 500 complaints during the downtime.
    -   Financial impact estimated at $15,000 due to unprocessed transactions.

----------

### **Resolution Steps**

1.  **Immediate Actions:**
    
    -   Stopped the problematic query execution using `kill` commands.
    -   Restarted the impacted application services.
2.  **Post-Incident Actions:**
    
    -   Implemented CPU usage monitoring alerts in Prometheus for early detection.
    -   Reviewed and optimized the database query for future executions.
    -   Limited bulk request queries to specific time slots to avoid peak usage.
    -   Added documentation for handling bulk data export requests.

### **Support Teams Involved**

1.  **Infrastructure Team:**
    -   John Doe (Team Lead)
    -   Mary Smith
2.  **Database Administration Team:**
    -   Alex Johnson
    -   Priya Patel
3.  **Application Development Team:**
    -   Carlos Garcia
    -   Sophia Liu

----------

### **Preventative Measures**

1.  Configure resource limits for the application processes using **cgroups**.
2.  Apply query throttling mechanisms in the application layer.
3.  Perform regular performance tests on critical database queries.
4.  Conduct monthly server health audits.
5.  Enhance logging to include detailed query execution times.

----------

### **Lessons Learned**

-   Real-time monitoring and resource alerting must be configured for all critical servers.
-   Standard operating procedures (SOPs) should be established for high-load scenarios.
-   Collaboration between teams can significantly reduce incident resolution time.

----------

### **Follow-Up Actions**

-   **Deadline:** 2024-11-10
-   **Owner:** Infrastructure Team

1.  Deploy enhanced monitoring and alerts for all production servers.
2.  Conduct team-wide training on identifying and handling high-load incidents.
3.  Update the incident response documentation to reflect this scenario.

----------

### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Causes**

1.  **Primary Cause:**
    
    -   The application log file size grew uncontrollably due to a misconfiguration in the logging framework, filling up the server's disk space.
2.  **Contributing Factors:**
    
    -   DEBUG-level logging was enabled in the production environment.
    -   No log rotation policy was in place, allowing the log file to grow indefinitely.
    -   Logging framework configuration file was accidentally updated during the last deployment.

----------

### **Incident Details**

-   **Description:**  
    At 09:20 AM UTC, monitoring tools flagged a critical disk space alert on the `app-prod-node12` server hosting the `InventoryManagementService`. Investigation revealed that the applicationâ€™s log file had grown to over 100 GB, consuming all available disk space. The application crashed shortly thereafter as it was unable to write to the log file or handle new requests.
    
-   **Impact:**
    
    -   Inventory updates and queries were unavailable to warehouse staff and external systems.
    -   Over 500 transactions failed during the downtime, resulting in business escalations.

----------

### **Code and Configuration Analysis**

The root cause was found in the logging configuration (`logback.xml`), which was inadvertently set to DEBUG-level logging without size-based rotation.

**Problematic Configuration:**

xml

Copy code

`<configuration>
    <appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
        <file>/var/log/inventory-app.log</file>
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>
    <root level="DEBUG">
        <appender-ref ref="FILE" />
    </root>
</configuration>` 

This configuration:

1.  Enabled DEBUG-level logging, resulting in excessive log entries.
2.  Did not include log rotation policies, allowing logs to grow indefinitely.

**Fixed Configuration:**

xml

Copy code

`<configuration>
    <appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
        <file>/var/log/inventory-app.log</file>
        <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy">
            <maxFileSize>100MB</maxFileSize>
        </rollingPolicy>
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>
    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="FILE" />
    </root>
</configuration>` 

The **fixed configuration**:

-   Changed the log level to INFO for production.
-   Introduced a rolling policy to limit log file size to 100 MB and automatically rotate files.

----------

### **Resolution Steps**

1.  **Immediate Actions:**
    
    -   Stopped the application to free up resources.
    -   Manually deleted old log files to reclaim disk space.
    -   Temporarily adjusted the logging level to WARN in the running application.
2.  **Post-Incident Actions:**
    
    -   Updated the logging configuration file to include proper rotation and adjusted log levels.
    -   Re-deployed the application with the fixed configuration after testing.

### **Support Teams Involved**

1.  **Application Development Team:**
    -   Priya Patel (Team Lead)
    -   Kevin Thomas
2.  **Infrastructure Team:**
    -   Linda Roberts
    -   Ahmed Khan

----------

### **Preventative Measures**

1.  Introduce automated validation of configuration files in the CI/CD pipeline to detect misconfigurations.
2.  Set up disk usage monitoring with proactive thresholds and alerts.
3.  Establish and enforce logging standards across all applications, including log rotation and production log levels.
4.  Conduct post-deployment checks to verify configuration integrity.

----------

### **Lessons Learned**

-   Misconfigured logging settings can lead to critical downtime in production environments.
-   Proper logging policies (e.g., rotation, file size limits) are essential for production stability.
-   Deployment pipelines should include configuration validation steps to catch issues before production releases.

----------

### **Follow-Up Actions**

-   **Deadline:** 2024-12-20
-   **Owner:** Application Development Team

1.  Audit all Java application configurations in production for logging best practices.
2.  Update deployment scripts to enforce production-ready logging settings.
3.  Train developers and DevOps teams on the importance of log management.

-   **Total Downtime:** 3 hours 45 minutes

----------

### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Causes**

1.  **Primary Cause:**
    
    -   High CPU usage caused by a conflict between the antivirus (AV) software and a scheduled Windows Defender scan running simultaneously.
2.  **Contributing Factors:**
    
    -   Misconfiguration in the antivirus exclusion settings caused it to scan files already being processed by Windows Defender.
    -   Scheduled scans for both antivirus tools overlapped during peak server usage hours.
    -   Lack of coordination between AV tools installed on the same system.

----------

### **Incident Details**

-   **Description:**  
    At 03:00 PM CST, performance degradation was detected on `app-prod-node04`, affecting backend services for the enterprise application. CPU utilization remained at 95-100% for over 30 minutes. Investigation revealed that simultaneous scanning activities by two antivirus tools (Vendor A and Windows Defender) created a resource contention issue, resulting in severe performance degradation.
    
-   **Impact:**
    
    -   Backend services were intermittently unavailable to users.
    -   Application response times increased to over 10 seconds per request.
    -   Multiple error reports were generated from API consumers due to timeout issues.

----------

### **Resolution Steps**

1.  **Immediate Actions:**
    
    -   Terminated the running Windows Defender scan using PowerShell.
    -   Disabled real-time scanning for Vendor Aâ€™s antivirus temporarily.
2.  **Post-Incident Actions:**
    
    -   Reconfigured antivirus exclusion settings to prevent overlap.
    -   Scheduled scans for non-peak hours to avoid resource contention.
    -   Conducted thorough testing to ensure both AV tools operate without conflict.

### **Support Teams Involved**

1.  **Infrastructure Team:**
    -   Michael Carter (Team Lead)
    -   Emma Brown
2.  **Security Operations Team:**
    -   Daniel Reed
    -   Aisha Patel

----------

### **Preventative Measures**

1.  Use a single, well-integrated antivirus tool across production servers to avoid conflicts.
2.  Clearly define exclusion policies and ensure they are implemented consistently.
3.  Schedule scans for low-usage periods and stagger schedules for multiple tools.
4.  Monitor server resource usage to detect early signs of performance degradation.

----------

### **Lessons Learned**

-   Running multiple antivirus tools without clear coordination creates unnecessary conflicts and resource usage spikes.
-   Regular audits of antivirus policies and schedules can prevent similar incidents.
-   Monitoring alerts for high resource usage should be paired with automatic throttling or termination of resource-heavy processes.

### **Follow-Up Actions**

-   **Deadline:** 2024-12-20
-   **Owner:** Security Operations Team

1.  Audit all production servers for antivirus conflicts and optimize exclusion settings.
2.  Migrate to a single antivirus solution for production environments where feasible.
3.  Document and distribute updated antivirus configuration and maintenance best practices.

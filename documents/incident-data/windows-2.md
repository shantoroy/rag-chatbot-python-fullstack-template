-   **Total Downtime:** 2 hours 30 minutes

----------

### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Causes**

1.  **Primary Cause:**
    
    -   Active Directory (AD) replication failure occurred due to an expired Secure Channel (Kerberos) trust between the primary domain controller (DC) and a secondary DC.
2.  **Contributing Factors:**
    
    -   A misconfiguration in the AD Sites and Services topology caused intermittent communication issues.
    -   The secure channel trust was not automatically re-established due to an outdated Windows patch level on the secondary DC.
    -   Monitoring alerts for AD replication latency were not configured for immediate escalation.

----------

### **Incident Details**

-   **Description:**  
    At 10:15 AM EST, authentication failures and delays in applying Group Policy were reported by multiple teams. Investigation revealed that replication between the primary domain controller (`ad-prod-node01`) and the secondary DC (`ad-prod-node02`) had failed, causing stale user and policy data to persist on the secondary DC.
    
-   **Impact:**
    
    -   Users were unable to authenticate to key systems, including file servers and intranet applications.
    -   Group Policy changes for critical updates were not propagated across the domain.
    -   Elevated login times and intermittent access issues were experienced by 500+ users.

----------

### **Resolution Steps**

1.  **Immediate Actions:**
    
    -   Manually reset the secure channel between the primary and secondary DCs using `nltest` and `Test-ComputerSecureChannel`.
    -   Forced replication of Active Directory objects using `repadmin /syncall`.
2.  **Post-Incident Actions:**
    
    -   Patched the secondary DC to the latest Windows Server update to fix secure channel re-establishment issues.
    -   Reconfigured the AD Sites and Services topology to optimize replication.
    -   Verified replication health across all domain controllers.

### **Support Teams Involved**

1.  **Infrastructure Team:**
    -   Jessica Harris (Team Lead)
    -   Carlos Perez
2.  **Active Directory Support Team:**
    -   Noah Johnson
    -   Priya Mehta

----------

### **Preventative Measures**

1.  Implement monitoring alerts for AD replication latency with immediate escalation for failures.
2.  Regularly audit and patch all domain controllers to ensure compatibility and stability.
3.  Configure automatic secure channel trust re-establishment across all domain controllers.
4.  Optimize the AD Sites and Services topology to minimize potential communication issues.

----------

### **Lessons Learned**

-   Proactive patching of domain controllers is critical to avoid compatibility issues.
-   Secure channel trust failures can significantly impact AD replication and authentication services.
-   Immediate monitoring and escalation mechanisms are necessary for critical systems like Active Directory.

----------

### **Follow-Up Actions**

-   **Deadline:** 2024-12-15
-   **Owner:** AD Support Team

1.  Review and update the AD Sites and Services topology for all production environments.
2.  Deploy the latest Windows Server patches to all domain controllers.
3.  Test and document the secure channel reset procedure for rapid recovery in future incidents.

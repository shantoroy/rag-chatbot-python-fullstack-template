### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Causes**

1.  **Primary Cause:**
    
    -   A memory leak occurred due to improper Hibernate configuration, where the `Session` objects were not closed after use, leading to heap memory exhaustion.
2.  **Contributing Factors:**
    
    -   Developers used an outdated connection pooling library that did not properly clean up database connections.
    -   Code review processes failed to detect the improper resource management issue.

----------

### **Incident Details**

-   **Description:**  
    At 01:30 PM UTC, monitoring tools reported high heap memory utilization for the `OrderManagementService` application. The application eventually crashed, causing downtime for order processing. Analysis of heap dump logs revealed thousands of unclosed `Session` objects, which were retained in memory due to poor resource management in the Hibernate configuration.
    
-   **Impact:**
    
    -   Order processing was disrupted for over 2,000 transactions.
    -   Customers experienced failed order submissions and payment processing errors.
    -   The downtime led to escalations from multiple business units.

----------

### **Code Analysis**

The root cause was identified in the DAO (Data Access Object) layer of the application. Specifically, the following code snippet failed to close Hibernate sessions:

**Problematic Code:**

java

Copy code

`public List<Order> getOrdersByStatus(String status) {
    Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
    Query<Order> query = session.createQuery("FROM Order WHERE status = :status", Order.class);
    query.setParameter("status", status);
    return query.getResultList(); // Session is not closed
}` 

This code caused the sessions to remain open and uncollected by the garbage collector, leading to memory exhaustion.

**Fixed Code:**

java

Copy code

`public List<Order> getOrdersByStatus(String status) {
    try (Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession()) {
        Query<Order> query = session.createQuery("FROM Order WHERE status = :status", Order.class);
        query.setParameter("status", status);
        return query.getResultList();
    } // The try-with-resources block ensures the session is closed
}` 

The **try-with-resources** statement automatically closes the `Session` after use, preventing memory leaks.

----------

### **Resolution Steps**

1.  **Immediate Actions:**
    
    -   Restarted the application to temporarily free heap memory.
    -   Increased heap memory allocation on the affected server to stabilize the application.
2.  **Post-Incident Actions:**
    
    -   Fixed the DAO implementation to properly close Hibernate sessions.
    -   Deployed the patched version to production after thorough testing.

### **Support Teams Involved**

1.  **Application Development Team:**
    -   Rajesh Gupta (Team Lead)
    -   Emily Tran
2.  **Infrastructure Team:**
    -   Lucas Martin
    -   Sarah Allen

----------

### **Preventative Measures**

1.  Enforce proper resource management best practices in all database operations.
2.  Conduct regular heap dump analysis in non-production environments to detect potential memory leaks.
3.  Update the connection pooling library to the latest, stable version.
4.  Enhance code review processes to include checks for resource cleanup.

----------

### **Lessons Learned**

-   Improper resource management in Java applications can lead to severe memory issues and downtime.
-   Automated tools like static code analyzers can help identify potential memory leaks.
-   Efficient use of modern Java features (e.g., try-with-resources) simplifies resource management and reduces errors.

### **Follow-Up Actions**

-   **Deadline:** 2024-12-15
-   **Owner:** Application Development Team

1.  Review and refactor all DAO methods across the application to ensure proper resource management.
2.  Integrate a static code analysis tool into the CI/CD pipeline to detect similar issues.
3.  Train developers on best practices for Hibernate and connection pooling configurations.

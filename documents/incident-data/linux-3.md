### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Causes**

1.  **Primary Cause:**
    
    -   The `/var` directory reached 100% capacity due to uncleaned log files generated by Jenkins build jobs.
2.  **Contributing Factors:**
    
    -   Lack of automated log rotation for Jenkins build artifacts and logs.
    -   Monitoring alerts for disk space usage were not configured for the `/var` partition.
    -   Inefficient partitioning during server setup allocated only 100GB to `/var` while larger unused space was available in `/data`.

----------

### **Incident Details**

-   **Description:**  
    At 02:30 PM PST, CI/CD pipelines failed during the deployment of the Web Portal application. Investigations revealed that the `/var` directory on `deploy-prod-node05` had run out of space, preventing Jenkins from creating new build artifacts and logs.
    
-   **Impact:**
    
    -   Multiple teams were unable to deploy updates to staging and production environments.
    -   Delay in releasing critical bug fixes and feature updates for the Web Portal.
    -   Developers lost 3+ hours troubleshooting the deployment failure.

----------

### **Resolution Steps**

1.  **Immediate Actions:**
    
    -   Cleared unnecessary and outdated logs in `/var/log/jenkins`.
    -   Moved older build artifacts to the `/data` partition.
    -   Restarted Jenkins to resume CI/CD operations.
2.  **Post-Incident Actions:**
    
    -   Implemented log rotation using `logrotate` for Jenkins logs.
    -   Updated the disk monitoring configuration to include the `/var` partition.
    -   Resized the `/var` partition to 200GB using Logical Volume Manager (LVM).
    -   Documented best practices for build artifact cleanup.

### **Support Teams Involved**

1.  **Infrastructure Team:**
    -   Robert King (Team Lead)
    -   Emily Wong
2.  **DevOps Team:**
    -   Sarah Connor
    -   Rajesh Iyer

----------

### **Preventative Measures**

1.  Automate log rotation across all production and deployment servers.
2.  Regularly monitor disk space utilization for critical partitions like `/var` and `/tmp`.
3.  Standardize server provisioning to allocate sufficient space for high-usage directories.
4.  Conduct monthly audits of build artifacts and set up retention policies for CI/CD logs.

----------

### **Lessons Learned**

-   Disk space monitoring must cover all critical partitions, not just `/` or `/home`.
-   Proactive log management can prevent service interruptions and minimize manual interventions.
-   Adequate partitioning during server setup is crucial for preventing storage-related issues.

----------

### **Follow-Up Actions**

-   **Deadline:** 2024-12-05
-   **Owner:** DevOps Team

1.  Implement log rotation for all Jenkins servers in production.
2.  Resize partitions on other deployment nodes to ensure sufficient space in `/var`.
3.  Establish retention policies for CI/CD logs and artifacts across all environments.

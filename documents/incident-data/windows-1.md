### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Causes**

1.  **Primary Cause:**
    
    -   The server experienced a **blue screen of death (BSOD)** caused by a faulty driver update for the network adapter.
2.  **Contributing Factors:**
    
    -   Automatic driver updates were enabled on the server, allowing an untested driver to be installed.
    -   The driver update conflicted with an existing virtual network interface configuration.
    -   Lack of rollback procedures for faulty driver updates in the server environment.

----------

### **Incident Details**

-   **Description:**  
    At 08:45 AM EST, users reported being unable to access the Corporate File Sharing Service. Investigation revealed that the server hosting the file share services had crashed and rebooted into recovery mode due to a BSOD triggered by a recently installed network adapter driver.
    
-   **Impact:**
    
    -   Over 1,000 users were unable to access critical shared files during the downtime.
    -   Collaborative work and workflows dependent on file access were disrupted.
    -   IT Helpdesk received over 200 support tickets.

----------

### **Resolution Steps**

1.  **Immediate Actions:**
    
    -   Rebooted the server into safe mode.
    -   Rolled back the network adapter driver to the last known stable version.
    -   Disabled automatic driver updates on the affected server.
2.  **Post-Incident Actions:**
    
    -   Verified the stability of the network interface and file sharing services after the rollback.
    -   Conducted a health check of the server and network configurations.

### **Support Teams Involved**

1.  **Infrastructure Team:**
    -   Liam Parker (Team Lead)
    -   Sophia Green
2.  **Network Team:**
    -   Ethan White
    -   Maya Singh

----------

### **Preventative Measures**

1.  Disable automatic driver updates on all production Windows servers.
2.  Establish a test environment for validating driver updates before deployment.
3.  Create a rollback procedure for any software or driver update issues.
4.  Monitor server health metrics (CPU, memory, and network interface performance) proactively.

----------

### **Lessons Learned**

-   Automatic updates on production servers can introduce unexpected instabilities.
-   Proactive driver validation and controlled updates are essential for minimizing service disruptions.
-   Comprehensive rollback mechanisms reduce recovery time during incidents caused by software changes.

----------

### **Follow-Up Actions**

-   **Deadline:** 2024-12-12
-   **Owner:** Infrastructure Team

1.  Audit all production servers to ensure automatic driver updates are disabled.
2.  Set up a pre-production environment for testing critical updates, including drivers.
3.  Document and train IT teams on rollback procedures for faulty updates.

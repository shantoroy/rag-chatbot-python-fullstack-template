### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Causes**

1.  **Primary Cause:**
    
    -   A database query used in a critical API endpoint (`/getCustomerDetails`) was performing a full table scan due to missing indexes.
2.  **Contributing Factors:**
    
    -   The query was introduced in a recent feature update without proper optimization.
    -   Code review and performance testing did not catch the issue in the staging environment due to smaller data volume.

----------

### **Incident Details**

-   **Description:**  
    At 10:45 AM UTC, performance monitoring tools flagged slow response times (over 15 seconds) for the `CustomerPortalService`. The issue was traced to a specific endpoint (`/getCustomerDetails`) frequently called by users. Further investigation revealed that the SQL query backing the endpoint was performing a full table scan on the `Customer` table, which had over 10 million records.
    
-   **Impact:**
    
    -   Over 80% of user requests to the customer portal timed out.
    -   Affected customers were unable to view their profile and transaction history.
    -   Multiple escalations from the customer support team due to user complaints.

----------

### **Code and Query Analysis**

The problematic query was embedded in the Java application code using JPA (Java Persistence API).

**Problematic Code:**

java

Copy code

`public Customer getCustomerDetails(String email) {
    String query = "SELECT c FROM Customer c WHERE c.email = :email";
    return entityManager.createQuery(query, Customer.class)
                        .setParameter("email", email)
                        .getSingleResult();
}` 

This code translated to an SQL query that performed a full table scan due to the lack of an index on the `email` column.

**Optimized Code:**

java

Copy code

`public Customer getCustomerDetails(String email) {
    String query = "SELECT c FROM Customer c WHERE c.email = :email";
    return entityManager.createQuery(query, Customer.class)
                        .setParameter("email", email)
                        .setHint("javax.persistence.query.timeout", 5000) // Added timeout
                        .getSingleResult();
}` 

Additionally, the following database index was created to optimize the query:

**Database Optimization:**

sql

Copy code

`CREATE INDEX idx_customer_email ON Customer (email);` 

----------

### **Resolution Steps**

1.  **Immediate Actions:**
    
    -   Temporarily limited access to the `CustomerPortalService` to reduce load.
    -   Restarted the database server to clear blocked queries.
2.  **Post-Incident Actions:**
    
    -   Added the missing index to the `Customer` table to improve query performance.
    -   Deployed a patched version of the application with updated query timeout settings.

### **Support Teams Involved**

1.  **Application Development Team:**
    -   Lisa Wong (Team Lead)
    -   Eric Johnson
2.  **Database Administration Team:**
    -   Mohammed Rahman
    -   Anna Torres

----------

### **Preventative Measures**

1.  Conduct database query optimization as part of the development lifecycle.
2.  Establish monitoring for slow queries in production environments.
3.  Include large-scale data testing in staging to mimic production volumes.
4.  Implement automated tools to detect and alert on unoptimized queries.

----------

### **Lessons Learned**

-   Database indexes play a critical role in application performance, and their absence can cause severe issues in production.
-   Performance issues may not surface in testing environments due to smaller data sizes; testing with production-like data is essential.
-   Query optimization and database design should be validated during code reviews and deployments.

----------

### **Follow-Up Actions**

-   **Deadline:** 2024-12-20
-   **Owner:** Application Development and DBA Teams

1.  Audit all database queries in the `CustomerPortalService` for performance issues.
2.  Train developers on best practices for database optimization and query design.
3.  Set up automated query performance monitoring tools, such as APM (Application Performance Management) solutions.
